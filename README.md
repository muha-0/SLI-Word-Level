# SLI-Word-Level
SLI (Sign Language Interpreter) is a deep learning-based system for real-time sign language translation at the word level. The project leverages MediaPipe for pose and hand landmark extraction and explores multiple deep learning architectures, including transformers and LSTMs with attention mechanisms. Trying different approaches, we achieved a model with 90% test accuracy.

Here is a video to illustrate how it works: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y_bmxzzyLHVoqKNX6o3S4n5tK4ZCYBr2/view?usp=sharing

# How to run:
You can load the model and run the main file directly. You can modify the main file as you want. Just use the sliding window technique mentioned in the report and you will be fine!
