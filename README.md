# SLI-Word-Level
SLI (Sign Language Interpreter) is a deep learning-based system for real-time sign language translation at the word level. The project leverages MediaPipe for pose and hand landmark extraction and explores multiple deep learning architectures, including transformers and LSTMs with attention mechanisms.
